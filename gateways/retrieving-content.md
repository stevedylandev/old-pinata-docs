# The Pinata Public Gateway

To get started, [you'll need to sign up for the Picnic Plan](https://pinata.cloud/billing). From there, you can go to our [Gateways page to create your first gateway](https://pinata.cloud/gateway).

{% hint style="info" %}
Pinata's Public Gateway is our public node for serving content pinned on IPFS
{% endhint %}

Pinata provides a **public gateway** for users who are just getting started:

[`https://gateway.pinata.cloud/`](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/)

An example of accessing content from this gateway:

[`https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeifx7yeb55armcsxwwitkymga5xf53dxiarykms3ygqic223w5sk3m`](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeifx7yeb55armcsxwwitkymga5xf53dxiarykms3ygqic223w5sk3m)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Public Gateway should not be used in production. It is designed for testing, is not designed for speed, and is heavily rate limited**.**\
\
If you are building for production, we recommend using a [dedicated-gateways.md](dedicated-gateways.md "mention") for optimal speed and quality.
