# ðŸ“½ Video Streaming

### Pinata Video Streaming :tv:

All users with a **dedicated gateway** will have access to **video streaming** via Pinata.

#### Why does video streaming matter?

To **stream** a video means that you can watch it without having to download an _entire video_. It's a faster way to access video content, as it isn't stored or downloaded directly on your device.

Video **streaming** allows your audience to watch your video content the same way they stream from major video content providers like YouTube and Netflix.

#### **How do I set up video streaming?**

All you have to do is append the following to the end of your gateway URL for any particular video: â€Œ&#x20;

`yourGatewayURL?stream=true` â€Œ&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This will apply to videos you have uploaded since getting access to the Video Streaming functionality. Any previously uploaded videos will need to be re-uploaded to get access to streaming. â€Œ&#x20;
{% endhint %}
