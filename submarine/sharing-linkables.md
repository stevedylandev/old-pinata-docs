## What are Linkables?

Linkables are a typically a string of two or more files that you can arrange into a story like feed. You can mix images, videos, even html content, and then add call to action buttons for each piece. This essentially gives you a customized, algorithm feed, that you can share to your followers or communities!&#x20;

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Uploading and Selecting Content

To start your first linkable, click on the "New Project" button from the dashboard.&#x20;

Then make sure Linkable is selected, then either upload or select the content you want to share. After its been selected, click "Next" on the Linkable bar. The next step is to arrange the content in the order that you want it to be seen. Lastly, you can add buttons or call to actions for each piece of content. Once you have done this, click "Finish" and then "Next Step" in the bottom right of the screen.&#x20;
