Once you‚Äôre on your dashboard, you‚Äôll be given the choice to upload a File, Folder, or CID (Content Identifier).

* **File**: Pinata allows you to upload any type of file including image files, video files, music files, text files, apps‚Äîanything you can imagine.
* **Folder**: You can upload an entire folder of content that you want to store and manage, including a collection of marketplace assets like videos, images or app files.
* **CID:** A content Identifier (also referred to as a CID) is a unique string of letters and numbers which represents a piece of data, and in the case of NFTs, proves that the NFT is really yours. A CID cannot be changed once in the IPFS network without changing the content attached to the CID as well. Learn more about pinning CIDs [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFNF0RX2O\_k).

**Choose what you would like to upload, give it a name, and press upload. (Note: You‚Äôll be able to edit the name later)**

**Voila! Your file is now uploaded to IPFS. It will be stored right on your Pinata dashboard for easy access.**

Once your file is pinned, then you have a few options of what to do next from your dashboard. Let‚Äôs look into a few.
