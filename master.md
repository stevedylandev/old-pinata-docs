## Your API Keys

Pinata offers developer keys for various scenarios. The most common scenario is normal IPFS actions (pinning content, unpinning, listing content, etc). These actions happen through the core Pinata API, and are documented in the Pinata API section. You can access and create your Pinata API keys here:&#x20;

If you are using Pinata's Submarine functionality, you'll need to generate Submarine Keys. You can do that here:&#x20;
