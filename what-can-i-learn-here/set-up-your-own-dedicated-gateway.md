# ⚡ Set up your own Dedicated Gateway

If you’re fetching content from IPFS for your audience, you want it quickly. But if you’re using public gateways, the more content that’s fetched, the slower the response times can be. [Dedicated gateways](https://www.pinata.cloud/blog/the-power-of-dedicated-gateways) solve this problem! No more rate-limiting, and you get to brand your dedicated gateway to create a more cohesive experience.

To set up your dedicated gateway, click ‘Gateway’ from your dashboard and then choose “Create Gateway”. (Note: Dedicated gateways are only available to paid users on [Picnic plans and above](http://pinata.cloud/pricing))
