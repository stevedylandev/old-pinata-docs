# ðŸ“‚ What is IPFS?

The InterPlanetary File System, also known as IPFS, is an incredibly powerful protocol that allows creators to host content too large for blockchains on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, leveraging cryptography to ensure content is unable to be changed.

The IPFS network is ideal for NFT projects that want to decentralize (transfer control from a centralized entity to a distributed network) their NFT media and make sure it does not change over time. IPFS also allows creators to take ownership of their content and how they share it.\
