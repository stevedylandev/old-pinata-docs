# 📌 What does "pinning" mean?

When you “pin” data on an IPFS node, you are telling that node that the data is important and it should be saved. A node is a program that connects you to IPFS and stores files.

Pinning prevents important data from being deleted from your node. You and only you can control and pin data on your node(s)—you can not force other nodes on the IPFS network to pin your content for you. So, to guarantee your content stays pinned, you have to run your own IPFS nodes.

Once your file is pinned to IPFS, you have full control to share, distribute, monetize and share your files however you’d like.
